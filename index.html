        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject I learned
        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I 
        honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

          I was an ENT for many years before joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
          the tree intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
          successfully switched careers. working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

        <q>
          - Before joining the bootcamp, I've
          never written a line of code. I needed
          some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to
          enroll by a former student of theirs
          who can only say wonderful things
          about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff did not
          disappoint. They were very hands-on
          and I never had to wait long tor
          assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took
          my learning to the next level ina way
          that no tutorial could ever have. In
          fact. I've often referred to it during
          interviews as an example of my
          developent experience. It certainly
          helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple
          offers. 100% recommend!

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
        themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
        their experiences was easy.
      </h1>
      <p>
        <q>
          The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
          program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
          myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.
